Let's take the expression
$$
	x_{n+1} = \alpha x_n
$$
where $x_n$ represents the population in year $n$. For $\alpha > 1$, we have population growth and for $\alpha < 1$ the population decreases. \\
If at time $t=0$ the population is $x_0$, at a given time we have
$$
	x_n = T_n(x_0) = \alpha^n x_0
$$
